# Mini-Knowledge-Graph
This project includes a real-world dataset named CareerAI that talks about helping job seekers write CVs, generate cover letters, and prepare for interviews using AI. In the Knowledge Graph, nodes represent core entities (e.g., Resume, Cover Letter), &amp; edges represent relationships between them (e.g., "generates", "uses prompt").
